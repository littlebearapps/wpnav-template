# Add Page Prompt

I want to add a new page to my WordPress site using WP Navigator.

## Page Details

Please help me plan and create a new page with these details:
- **Page Title**: [describe the page]
- **Purpose**: [what is this page for?]
- **Content Sections**: [what sections should it have?]

## Process

1. Review my current site structure in `snapshots/site_index.json`
2. Propose a page structure that fits my site
3. Update `wpnavigator.jsonc` with the new page definition
4. Show me how to preview and apply the change

## Guidelines

- Match my site's existing style and tone
- Keep the structure simple and maintainable
- Ensure the page slug doesn't conflict with existing pages

## After Planning

Guide me through:
```bash
npx wpnav diff            # See proposed changes
npx wpnav sync --dry-run  # Preview what will be created
npx wpnav sync            # Apply the change
```
